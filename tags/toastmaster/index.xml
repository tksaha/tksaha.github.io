      <description>Mr. or (Madam) Toastmaster,
Fellow members and guest, as you know, the title of my speech is re-invent yourself. In this speech, I will share you one of my personal struggles and how did I circumvent my struggle to achieve success.
I born in small town in a middle-class family in Bangladesh. With my mom, dad, and brother I had a wonderful life. However, my Dad had to move a lot because of the job, and each and every time we also moved with him as my mom thought he is the best person who could teach us well.</description>

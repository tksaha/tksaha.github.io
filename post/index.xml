      <description>Ruwan and I spend a lot of time together in Starbucks before his defense. He shared his experience s with 3D printer and all other cool stuff he does at home. I visited his home recently and was amazed by his works. His wife also entertained me with the delicious tea. He suggested starting with Lego Mindstorm ev3 as it has nice programming experience module. I bought the toolkit on that day.</description>

      <description>Mr. or (Madam) Toastmaster,
Fellow members and guest, as you know, the title of my speech is re-invent yourself. In this speech, I will share you one of my personal struggles and how did I circumvent my struggle to achieve success.
I born in small town in a middle-class family in Bangladesh. With my mom, dad, and brother I had a wonderful life. However, my Dad had to move a lot because of the job, and each and every time we also moved with him as my mom thought he is the best person who could teach us well.</description>
